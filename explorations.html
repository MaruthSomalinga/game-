<h1>Explorations</h1>
<p>
The way we went about designing this game was to first pick a board we all liked then gathering all the moving pieces and non-moving pieces. After choosing the pieces and "furniture" of the game we brain stromed concepts or ideas that we would take from other games to make our own. We decided on adding the elements of powerups that would grants you the power to pick a card and receive gold. The rules that we generated were Role dice in a cup, based on the 2 dice combined. If you land in the pool you get sent back to the start. If you land on the orange spot then you either get to run someone over in a car and send them back to the start or get shot and get sent back to the start. If you land on the p spot you get to pick an uno card and get gold which is the currency of the game. If you end up in front of Santa, he gets some of your money.The theme that we wanted to depict from the game is a life sort of game, somewhat resembling the separate parts of life but also adding some new elements that would excite the players instead of monotonous activities. A final summary of the game would be in this game called gold rush, the premise is to end up with the most amount of money by the end of the game. In between, you will face challenges like the tax collector and the swimming pool, but you will also get to enjoy the fun game play by earning money and running people over.
